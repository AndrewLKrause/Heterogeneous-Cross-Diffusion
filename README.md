# Heterogeneous-Cross-Diffusion
Code to simulate general nonlinear reaction-cross-diffusion systems with spatial heterogeneity. The files SchStat.m, SchMov.m, and SchStatMov.m all simulate a cross-diffusion version of the Schnakenberg system with different heterogeneous parameters. The file KellerSegel.m does the same for a heterogeneous Keller-Segel cell-chemotaxis model, and the file SKT.m does the same for a heterogeneous Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto model. In all cases the systems and their parameters and steady states are specified in these files, with runModel.m called to simulate them via method-of-lines and ode15s, and plotSim used to plot kymographs and line plots of solutions. The line plot produced is at the final time (specified in runModel.m), and includes a plot of the analytical steady state provided, as well as approximate Turing space boundaries computed via computeTuringBoundaries.m, which uses a local version of the algebraic Turing conditions valid for sufficiently small epsilon.
